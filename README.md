### Community discussion and documentation for the US National Weather Service API
Welcome! This repository is here to serve as a meeting place for developers in the general public to interface with
each other and the NWS API development team. This will allow us to gather better feedback on user needs and respond
more quickly to concerns.

You can start reading our documentation at [https://weather-gov.github.io/api](https://weather-gov.github.io/api)
